#SSV Theme Styleguide

##Getting started

###Prerequisites:
The SSV Styleguide has a few dependencies that you will need to install to use it. Don't worry, we're got all the link you need right here:

* [Composer](https://getcomposer.org/) – Dependency Manager for PHP,
* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) – The backbone of the framework. Node Package Manager takes care of installing all the dev dependencies,
* [Gulp](http://gulpjs.com/) – Task manager and automation. Gulp is responsible for running all the small tasks like compiling SCSS and Twig templates, starting a web server and automatically reloading browsers.

###Starting a new project
So you got the prerequisites installed, and you're ready to get started? Great! Just follow the simple steps below:


1. Download a copy of the framework.

3. Run below command to install all the required packages with Node Package Manager.
